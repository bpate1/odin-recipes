        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>Chicken: 1 whole chicken, cut into pieces or chicken parts of your choice</li>
            <li>Buttermilk: 1 cup</li>
            <li>Flour: 2 cups</li>
            <li>Cayenne Pepper: 2 tablespoons</li>
            <li>Paprika: 2 tablespoons</li>
            <li>Garlic Powder: 1 tablespoon</li>
            <li>Onion Powder: 1 tablespoon</li>
            <li>Black Pepper: 1 tablespoon</li>
            <li>Salt: 1 tablespoon</li>
            <li>Oil: For frying, enough to submerge the chicken pieces in the frying vessel</li>
            <li>Hot Sauce: 1/4 cup (adjust to your desired spiciness)</li>
            <li>Brown Sugar: 2 tablespoons</li>
            <li>Unsalted Butter: 1/4 cup</li>
            <li>White Bread: Sliced, as needed for serving</li>
            <li>Pickles: Sliced, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the Chicken: Place the chicken in a large bowl and
                cover it with buttermilk. Ensure all the chicken is coated, then
                cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it marinate in the
                refrigerator for at least 1 hour (overnight for even better
                results).</li>
            <li>Prepare the Dredging Mixture: In a separate shallow dish, mix
                the flour with a combination of cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic
                powder, onion powder, black pepper, and salt. The exact amounts
                of spices can be adjusted according to your preferred level of
                spiciness.</li>
            <li>Dredge the Chicken: Take each chicken piece from the buttermilk,
                allowing any excess to drip off, and dredge it in the seasoned
                flour mixture. Make sure the chicken is evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Heat the Oil: In a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven, heat
                vegetable oil or similar over medium-high heat until it reaches
                350-375째F (175-190째C).</li>
            <li>Fry the Chicken: Carefully add the coated chicken pieces to the
                hot oil, working in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding
                the pan. Fry the chicken until it is golden brown and cooked
                through, which usually takes about 15-20 minutes depending on
                the size of the pieces. Use a meat thermometer to ensure the
                internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165째F (74째C).</li>
            <li>Make the Hot Sauce: While the chicken is frying, prepare the hot
                sauce. In a small saucepan, melt butter and mix it with hot
                sauce and brown sugar. Adjust the hot sauce and sugar amounts to
                achieve the desired level of heat and sweetness.</li>
            <li>Coat the Chicken: Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the
                oil and let it drain on a wire rack or paper towels. While the
                chicken is still hot, brush or drizzle the hot sauce mixture
                over it, ensuring each piece is thoroughly coated.</li>
            <li>Serve: Place a slice of white bread on a plate, top it with the
                hot chicken, and add a few dill pickle chips on the side. Enjoy
                the crispy, spicy goodness!</li>
        </ol>
