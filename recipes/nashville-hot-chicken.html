        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the Chicken: Place the chicken pieces in a large bowl
                and cover them with buttermilk. Ensure all the chicken is
                coated, then cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it
                marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour (overnight for
                even better results).</li>
            <li>Prepare the Dredging Mixture: In a separate shallow dish, mix
                the all-purpose flour with a combination of cayenne pepper,
                paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and salt.
                The exact amounts of spices can be adjusted according to your
                preferred level of spiciness.</li>
            <li>Dredge the Chicken: Take each chicken piece from the buttermilk,
                allowing any excess to drip off, and dredge it in the seasoned
                flour mixture. Make sure the chicken is evenly coated with the
                flour mixture.</li>
            <li>Heat the Oil: In a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven, heat
                vegetable oil over medium-high heat until it reaches around
                350-375째F (175-190째C).</li>
            <li>Fry the Chicken: Carefully add the coated chicken pieces to the
                hot oil, working in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding
                the pan. Fry the chicken until it is golden brown and cooked
                through, which usually takes about 15-20 minutes depending on
                the size of the pieces. Use a meat thermometer to ensure the
                internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165째F (74째C).</li>
            <li>Make the Hot Sauce: While the chicken is frying, prepare the hot
                sauce. In a small saucepan, melt butter and mix it with hot
                sauce and brown sugar. Adjust the hot sauce and sugar amounts to
                achieve the desired level of heat and sweetness.</li>
            <li>Coat the Chicken: Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the
                oil and let it drain on a wire rack or paper towels. While the
                chicken is still hot, brush or drizzle the hot sauce mixture
                over it, ensuring each piece is thoroughly coated.</li>
            <li>Serve: To serve Nashville hot chicken traditionally, place a
                slice of white bread on a plate, top it with the hot chicken,
                and add a few dill pickle chips on the side. Enjoy the crispy,
                spicy goodness!</li>
