        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Potato salad is a beloved classic in Southern American cuisine. It
            features tender, boiled potatoes mixed with a creamy dressing of
            mayo, mustard, and tangy apple cider vinegar or pickle juice.
            Additional ingredients like hard-boiled eggs, pickles, onions, and
            sometimes bacon add texture and flavor. Seasoned with salt, pepper,
            and a hint of paprika or cayenne, this comforting side dish is
            perfect for gatherings and barbecues, complementing a variety of
            main dishes.</p>

            <li>Bacon: 4 slices, cooked and crumbled (optional)</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the potatoes: Place the potatoes in a large pot, cover them
                with water, and bring to a boil. Cook the potatoes until they
                are fork-tender, about 15-20 minutes. Drain and let them cool
                completely.</li>
            <li>Prepare the dressing: In a separate bowl, mix together the
                mayonnaise, mustard, and apple cider vinegar or pickle juice.
                Stir until well combined, creating a creamy dressing.</li>
            <li>Dice the potatoes: Once the potatoes are cooled, peel them
                (optional) and dice them into bite-sized pieces. Place the diced
                potatoes in a large mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the ingredients: To the diced potatoes, add the chopped
                hard-boiled eggs, pickles or pickle relish, onions, celery,
                green onions, and crumbled bacon (if using).</li>
            <li>Season the salad: Pour the dressing over the potato mixture,
                gently tossing everything together to coat the potatoes and
                ingredients evenly. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Chill and serve: Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and
                refrigerate the potato salad for at least an hour to allow the
                flavors to meld. Before serving, sprinkle paprika or cayenne
                pepper on top for a touch of spice.</li>
            <li>Enjoy: Serve the chilled Southern potato salad as a delicious
                side dish alongside your favorite meals.</li>
