        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Southern collard greens are a beloved and hearty dish in Southern
            cuisine. Made from the sturdy, dark green leaves of the collard
            plant, they are slow-cooked with smoky ingredients like bacon, along
            with onions, garlic, and chili peppers for added
            flavor. The result is a rich and comforting taste. Often served as a
            side dish, collard
            greens hold cultural significance, reflecting a connection to
            African American heritage and the resourcefulness of the past.
            Whether enjoyed at family gatherings or festive occasions, they
            bring warmth and a sense of history to Southern tables.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Collard Greens</li>
            <li>Bacon</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Chicken Broth</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the collard greens: Thoroughly wash the collard greens
                under cold running water. Remove any tough stems and ribs from
                the leaves, then stack the leaves on top of each other and slice
                them into thick strips.</li>
            <li>Cook the meat: In a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat,
                cook the bacon until it releases its fat and starts to brown.
                This step adds the smoky and savory flavors to the dish.</li>
            <li>Add the onions and garlic: Add the chopped onions to the pot
                with the meat and cook until they become translucent. Stir in
                the minced garlic and chopped chili peppers (if using) and cook
                for another minute or so until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the collard greens: Place the sliced collard greens into the
                pot, stirring to coat them with the meat and onion mixture. The
                greens may seem voluminous at first, but they will wilt down as
                they cook.</li>
            <li>Pour in the liquid: Pour in the chicken broth or water, covering
                the collard greens. The liquid will help to simmer and cook the
                greens.</li>
            <li>Season the collard greens: Season the mixture with salt and
                pepper to taste. You can also add any additional spices or
                seasonings you prefer at this stage.</li>
            <li>Simmer the collard greens: Bring the pot to a boil, then reduce
                the heat to low. Cover the pot and let the collard greens simmer
                for about 1 to 1.5 hours or until they are tender and fully
                cooked. The cooking time may vary based on the toughness of the
                greens and the size of the leaves.</li>
            <li>Check for doneness: Test the collard greens for doneness by
                tasting a piece. They should be tender but still have a slight
                bite.</li>
            <li>Serve: Once the collard greens are fully cooked and tender, they
                are ready to be served. You can enjoy them as a side dish
                alongside your favorite Southern meals or as a main course with
                some cornbread on the side.</li>
