        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Collard greens are a beloved and hearty dish in Southern cuisine.
            Made from the sturdy, dark green leaves of the collard plant, they
            are slow-cooked with smoky ingredients like bacon, along with onions
            and garlic for added flavor. The end result is a gratifying and
            deeply satisfying taste experience. Frequently gracing the table as
            a beloved side dish during family gatherings and festive events,
            these greens infuse Southern meals with a comforting warmth and a
            connection to the region's rich culinary traditions.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Collard Greens: 2 pounds, washed, stems removed, and chopped into bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>Bacon: 4 slices, chopped</li>
            <li>Onion: 1 medium-sized, finely chopped</li>
            <li>Garlic: 3 cloves, minced</li>
            <li>Chicken Broth: 2 cups (you can also use vegetable broth if you prefer)</li>
            <li>Salt: 1 teaspoon (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>Pepper: 1/2 teaspoon (adjust to taste)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the collard greens: Thoroughly wash the collard greens
                under cold running water. Remove any tough stems and ribs from
                the leaves, then stack the leaves on top of each other and slice
                them into thick strips.</li>
            <li>Cook the meat: In a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat,
                cook the bacon until it releases its fat and starts to brown.
                This step adds the smoky and savory flavors to the dish.</li>
            <li>Add the onions and garlic: Add the chopped onions to the pot
                with the meat and cook until they become translucent. Stir in
                the minced garlic and cook for another minute or so until
                fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the collard greens: Place the sliced collard greens into the
                pot, stirring to coat them with the meat and onion mixture. The
                greens may seem voluminous at first, but they will wilt down as
                they cook.</li>
            <li>Pour in the liquid: Pour in the chicken broth or water, covering
                the collard greens. The liquid will help to simmer and cook the
                greens.</li>
            <li>Season the collard greens: Season the mixture with salt and
                pepper to taste. You can also add any additional spices or
                seasonings you prefer at this stage.</li>
            <li>Simmer the collard greens: Bring the pot to a boil, then reduce
                the heat to low. Cover the pot and let the collard greens simmer
                for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until they are tender and fully
                cooked. The cooking time may vary based on the toughness of the
                greens and the size of the leaves.</li>
            <li>Check for doneness: Test the collard greens for doneness by
                tasting a piece. They should be tender but still have a slight
                bite.</li>
            <li>Serve: Once the collard greens are fully cooked and tender, they
                are ready to be served. You can enjoy them as a side dish, or as
                a main course with some cornbread on the side.</li>
        </ol>
